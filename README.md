# Using LLMs for Faculty Course Matching Project
This project aims to improve the process of matching faculty to courses at universities by leveraging large language models (LLMs).This will ensure efficient allocation of faculty expertise to appropriate courses, enhancing overall educational quality.
# Project Description
This project create a prompt engineering methodology utilizing LLMs to align faculty resumes with program course descriptions, identifying gaps and facilitating the assignment of courses.This project aims to improve the process of matching faculty to courses at universities by leveraging large language models (LLMs). The current system uses basic text similarity scoring in R. By utilizing the advanced natural language capabilities of LLMs through prompt engineering, we can automate the matching process to quickly and accurately align faculty skills and interests with course needs.The technology tools will automatically generate a list of courses in order of similarity score. Our clients can use this productive tool to assign highly relevant courses based on individual resumes quickly.
